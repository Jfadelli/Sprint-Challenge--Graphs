Graph Sprint Comments

0.		Initial thoughts... Depth first search to reach end of maze, 
		stack allows for a backtracking

7. 		Create a stack

23. 	Create a my hero to hold importand values and logic

32. 	Create function to update the traversal graph, 
		if current room not in graph, add it to graph
	
		Get available directions, if direction hasn't 
		been visited mark it as '?'

44. 	Create reverse function that returns opposite

50. 	Create move function that...
		* takes in a direction
		* updates the traversal graph (ln 32) sets the 
		  "from_room" attribute
		* calls travel function from player.py and
		  passes in direction
		* updates the traversal graph again
		* checks if current room is '?'
		  sets the current location
		  updates the reverse direction

64. 	Create a function that makes a path for final 
		solution (steps commented in green)
	
92. 	Create a function to add directions
		* Takes in the direction last traveled
		* outputs a stack update for backtracking and
		  new rooms if neighbors are unvisited
